## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for "Carzeek," a portfolio website designed for a car shop, specifically catering to luxury vehicles. This website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Project Background

"Carzeek" is one of my initial projects, created in 2020 as I was exploring the fundamentals of front-end development. This website serves as a digital showcase for a luxury car shop, highlighting its offerings and unique value propositions. The primary purpose of maintaining this repository is to demonstrate the evolution of my coding skills over time.

### Motivation

By sharing "Carzeek," I aim to inspire others who are just beginning their journey in web development. This project illustrates that with dedication and hard work, it is possible to create professional and visually appealing websites. I hope that this repository encourages aspiring developers to persist in their learning and to tackle the challenges that come with developing complex web applications.
